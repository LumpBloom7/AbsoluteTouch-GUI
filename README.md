AbsoluteTouch GUI
------------------
This software is made to be used with [AbsoluteTouch](https://github.com/apsun/AbsoluteTouch). 

It serves as a launcher for configuring options and starting the software.

All of the functions of the original program should work except for automatic touchpad enabling. All of the functionality are also explained in the GUI itself.

The launcher hides itself to the notification area when minimized, bringing clutter to a minimum.

**NOTE: User must download the AbsoluteTouch binary and place them in the same directory as the GUI for the GUI to function properly.**
